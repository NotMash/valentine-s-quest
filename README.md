## About

Valentine’s Quest is a short interactive web game created as a personal project. It was built as a Valentine’s gift for Shahina, combining simple gameplay, animation, and a custom interface into a single-page web experience.

The project focuses on building something meaningful using modern frontend tools rather than creating a large or complex game.
